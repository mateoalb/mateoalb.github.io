# Overview
This project showcases my custom built motorized blind, designed to integrate seamlessly with Apple HomeKit using homespan. I developed two versions, one powered by a servo motor and another using a DC motor with a driver board in order to explore different approaches for torque, reliability, and installation flexibility.

## Features
- HomeKit Integration – Built with HomeSpan, an open-source library that brings native HomeKit support to ESP32 boards.
- Two Motor Options:
  - Servo Motor Version
  - DC Motor Version
- 3D-Printed Connector – Custom-designed attachment connects the motor shaft to the blinds’ tilt rod.
- [Homekit](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/tree/master) Control– Operated directly from an apple device.
